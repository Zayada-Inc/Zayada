Gym Management System (GMS)
A powerful and modern gym management solution built using .NET Core API and React. The project aims to create a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly and iteratively enhance the architecture for production use, potentially transitioning to a modular monolith or microservices design.

Features
Gym Subscriptions: Customers can buy and manage their gym subscriptions.
Gym Management: Administrators can manage gym operations, including classes, schedules, and trainers.
Caching: Uses Redis for efficient caching and improved performance.
Payments: Securely processes payments through Stripe integration.
Email Notifications: Sends email notifications to users for various events (e.g., subscription confirmation, class updates).
Photos: Users can upload and update their profile photos.
Personal Trainer Classes: Users can join personal trainer classes and track their progress.
Getting Started
This project uses a simple clean architecture, making it easy to understand and extend. To get started, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to set up your development environment.

Future Development
We are committed to enhancing the architecture and functionality of the GMS. In the future, we plan to transition to a more robust architecture, such as a modular monolith or microservices, for better scalability and maintainability.
